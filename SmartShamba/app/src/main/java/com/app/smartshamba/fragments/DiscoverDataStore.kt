However, succeeding in the maize production business requires knowledge and skill. \n Based on my research, we have identified some things entrepreneurs should consider and keep in mind if they plan to get involved in the maize business. Here they are:","","","","",""

        descPreparation = arrayOf("The first and most important thing you will need to get started with maize production is land.\n Maize grows best in rich loamy or sandy-loam soils in a well-drained area that has a flat or fairly flat landscape. Maize will not do well in waterlogged land. If the land is not well drained, you could make ridges or mounds to protect the crops from waterlogging.\n Because the maize plant loves sunlight, the land has to be in the open and free from any kind of shade (such as tall trees or man-made structures) that prevents sunlight from reaching the planted maize.\n The land has to be cleared and tilled before the rainy season starts and the maize should be planted immediately after the land is prepared. If this is not done, weeds may grow fast and compete with the maize for nutrients and sunlight.\n","","","","","")

        descPestControl = arrayOf("There are several types of weeds, pests and diseases that affect maize plants such as stem borers, army worms, grasshoppers, larger grain borers, downy mildew, maize streak virus and Striga among others. Fortunately, there are several herbicides, pesticides and disease control methods you can apply to prevent a breakout on your farm. The manual in the next section contains useful information about these methods and how you can apply them.","","","","","")

        descHarvesting = arrayOf("The amount of maize that can be harvested (per hectare) depends on the variety you planted, amount of rainfall, sunshine and the level of weed, pest and disease control management that was applied.Although Africa has some of the lowest maize yields in the world, it is not uncommon to expect between 2,000 to 4,000 kilograms per hectare.","","","","","")
